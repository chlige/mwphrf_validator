<h2 id="view">Viewing and filtering entries</h2>

<p>Once the entries are loaded into the main table they can be sorted by any of the columns by clicking on the column headers or filtered by racing circle, division and/or class using the pull-down boxes near the top of the window.  Please note, these categories are nested, i.e. classes are part of a division which are part of a circle.<p>

<h2 id="find_ratings">Finding/downloading MWPHRF details</h2>

<p>MWPHRF details, i.e. certificates, can be downloaded from the MWPHRF website using the <b>Find Ratings</b> button.  
The application will find possible entries searching first by sail number and yacht name.  
If no entries are found, then it will search the MWPHRF website by the make and model of the entry.  
If an entry is found that has the same sail number and name it will be automatically selected and displayed in the <i>PHRF Match</i> column.   
If there is not an entry that match those criteria, then it will list the number of records fetched for that entry. </p>

<h3>Selecting a MWPHRF record</h3>

<p>To manually select a desired MWPHRF record for the entry click on the row in the <i>PHRF Match</i> column to display a dropdown box and select the desired MWPHRF record to use for that entry.
<b>NOTE:</b> automatically selected matches can also be changed by clicking on the match and using the same dropdown box feature to change the desired MWPHRF record to use.</p>

<h3>Selecting a MWPHRF certificate year</h3>

<p>When a MWPHRF record is selected, either manually or automatically, the <i>Certificate Year</i> column will display the most recent certificate year for that MWPHRF record.  The certificate year can be changed by clicking on the year and selecting the year from the dropdown box that appears</p>

<h3>Selecting a MWPHRF value</h3>

<p>MWPHRF certificates typically contain four (4) different values; BHCP, HCP, DHCP and NSHCP.  
The value displayed in the table can be selected by pressing the <b>HCP</b>, <b>DHCP</b> or <b>NSHCP</b> buttons above the table.  
When pressing this button it will set the displayed value for all entries currently <i>visible</i> in the table. 
It is possible, once the MWPHRF records have been loaded and selected for each entry, to use the <i>circle</i>, <i>division</i> and <i>class</i> filters to restrict the entries when using the <b>HCP</b>, <b>DHCP</b> or <b>NSHCP</b> buttons.  
For example, one could press <b>HCP</b> to use the standard handicap for all entries, then use the <i>class</i> filter to select the non-spinnaker class and click <b>NSHCP</b> to use the non-spinnaker value for entries in the non-spinnaker class while retaining the HCP rating for all other entries.
The value used for individual entries can be also be changed by clicking on the value for that entry and selecting the desired value from the dropdown box</p>
